bucket --> JOURNAl.GZ and .tsidx (time series Index Files)
JOURNAL -- _raw_event data  it contain slices of 128kb each files 
tsidx --  are index keys to our journal files it tells splunk which slice of to openup inorder find the result looking for the search 
  tsidx files are made - splunk take raw and chooses common unique term in data an tokenize them to lexicon in .tsidx
   Each lexicon has unique posting list array it will give the location of the data from the journal array.

tsidx contains -- lexicon and posting 

Bloomfilter: it will be created when the data move from hot to warm
     the unqiue terms go through certain hashing functions and set the 0 and 1 in bloomfilters simillarlly search key words go through same hashing and set 0 and 1 and it will compare for the match bloomfilter in all bucket . Comparing bloomfilter is much efficient way than searching on tsidx

Transforming command: stats, timechart, chart, top, rare.  it is executed in search Head
Streaming commands: centralized - transaction, streamstats and Distributable - eval, rename, feild, regex. it is executed in the Indexer.

Segmatation:major and minor breakerse
lisby expression: splunk uses lisby expression to build bloomfilters and to locate term in tsidx files.

Troubleshoot command:

 - | makeresults used to generate temporary event in memory.
    it is used when one or more eval commands used
    must be the first command in search
    if we need to add any static data at search time it is not in your index

 - | fieldsummary calculates a variety of summary statistics.

----------------------------------------------------------------
creating feild extraction: (manual)
   feilds are searchable key value pair
   they may be extracted in index time or search time or may be persistant or created in temporary memeory 
   
The feild extrator:
   two methods for feild extractor - Regular exp and delimiters
   regular exp - for unstructured data.  
   delimiter - is used when the data are seperated same character like , | \ ....

------------------------------------------
   | chart, timechart, top, rare, stats

chart - | chart count over id by host limit=10 useother=f ..... 
timechart - it will count all data based on time  
top -- show the highest value
rare -- written the least count 
stats -- it is similar to table
-----------------------------------------
functions- sum

| stats min(price) as cost ,
max(id) as ID, avg(price) as price , sum(price) as price  by component

| stats values(user) as "user" -- it is display unique users 
|stats list(user) as "user" -- it display with duplicate values
-----------------------------------------
|eval   -- it is for operations (arithmetic, concatenation, boolean, comparison)

---------------------------------------------------

Data model 

3 types of dataset - events, searches, transaction

event command doesn't contain transforming com 
search com contain pipe 
tansaction com contain transaction com
